In my SQL project titled "Layoffs," I focused on cleaning and preparing a dataset related to employee layoffs to ensure its accuracy and usability for analysis. The first step involved removing duplicates to eliminate redundant entries that could skew the results. Next, I standardized the data by ensuring consistent formatting across all fields, such as date formats and text casing, to maintain uniformity. I then checked for null and blank values, addressing any missing or incomplete data by either filling in the gaps or removing irrelevant entries. Finally, I removed unnecessary columns that did not contribute to the analysis, streamlining the dataset for better performance and clarity. This comprehensive cleaning process resulted in a more reliable and efficient dataset, ready for insightful analysis and decision-making.
